# SPEC.md — Philippine Individual Tax Compliance System
**Kuwenta** | Full-Stack Web Application Specification  
Tax Framework: TRAIN Law (RA 10963) | RR No. 8-2018 | RMO No. 23-2018  
Track: Local Finance & Real World Access — APAC Stellar Hackathon 2026

---

## Overview

A web-based tax compliance engine for Filipino self-employed professionals and freelancers operating under the BIR's 8% flat income tax rate. The system guides users through all 8 mandatory BIR returns in the correct legally-mandated sequence, automates tax computation from BIR Form 2307 data, generates a complete filing package, and anchors every filed return as a tamper-proof receipt on the Stellar blockchain.

**The single demo moment:** A Filipino freelancer uploads their Form 2307 certificates, the system computes their full tax position, generates 8 sequenced returns, and each filed return is permanently anchored on Stellar — producing a verifiable compliance trail that banks and embassies can check in seconds.

**Compliance overview — the home screen**
- Greeting with taxpayer name and TIN
- Active taxable year selector (defaults to current year)
- **Filing Roadmap** — visual checklist of all 8 required returns showing status per return:
  - Filed (green) — return confirmed filed, Stellar TX ID shown
  - Pending (amber) — prerequisites met, ready to file
  - Blocked (red) — predecessor return not yet filed
- VAT threshold progress bar (₱0 → ₱3,000,000) with warning indicator at ₱2,400,000
- Quick stats: Total Gross Income YTD, Total CWT YTD, Estimated Tax Position
- Upcoming deadline reminders (next 3 returns due)
- Quick action buttons: Add 2307 Certificate, View Filing Package

---

### 3. `/onboarding`
**Taxpayer registration — one-time setup**

Step 1 — Personal Information
- Full registered name (as on BIR COR)
- TIN (format: NNN-NNN-NNN-NNNN, validated and duplicate-checked)
- RDO Code
- Registered address, ZIP code
- Nature of business / profession
- **Nature of Income** — single select: `Pure Self-Employment` or `Mixed Income (Salary + Freelance)`
  - If `Mixed Income`: the ₱250,000 statutory exemption is NOT applied in any computation (already absorbed by the compensation side). Annual return is Form 1701, not 1701A. Legal basis: RR No. 8-2018 Sec. 3(D); RMC No. 50-2018; BIR Form 1701-MS (Aug 2024) Item 22.
- **Are you a new BIR registrant?** — Yes / No
  - If `Yes`: taxpayer elected 8% rate at the time of initial BIR registration via Form 1901. This is a valid pre-election — no Item 13 on 2551Q or Item 16 on 1701Q is required because the election was already made at registration. System records election status as confirmed and pre-populates the election flag. Legal basis: RR No. 8-2018 Sec. 3; BIR Form 1901.
  - If `No`: election must be made via Item 13 on Q1 2551Q, Item 16 on Q1 1701Q, or Form 1905.
- **COR includes 2551Q?** — Yes / No
  - If `No`: taxpayer registered with BIR already declaring 8% at signup; BIR removes 2551Q from their registered tax types. Skip all 2551Q filings — total returns reduced from 8 to 4 (1701Q Q1, Q2, Q3, and 1701A only). Legal basis: RMO No. 23-2018 Sec. C.2.1–2.3; BIR Form 2303.
  - If `Yes`: standard 8-return path applies.
- **Annual Registration Fee** — as of January 22, 2024 under RA 11976 (Ease of Paying Taxes Act), the ₱500 annual BIR registration fee has been abolished. Only the ₱30 Documentary Stamp Tax applies. If onboarding references any registration costs, display ₱30 DST only — never ₱500. Legal basis: RA No. 11976 Sec. 18; RR No. 6-2024.

Step 2 — Eligibility Check
- System validates all 5 conditions simultaneously and displays pass/fail per condition:
  1. Individual taxpayer (not corporation or partnership)
  2. Income from self-employment or profession (mixed-income earners routed to separate path — no ₱250,000 deduction, Form 1701 as annual return)
  3. Non-VAT registered
  4. Gross receipts below ₱3,000,000
  5. No prior Q1 return filed under graduated rate for this taxable year
- All 5 must pass to proceed

Step 3 — ATC Code Setup
- Add one or more ATC codes applicable to the taxpayer
- Lookup table with ATC code, description, and EWT rate
- Pre-filled options: WI071 (Insurance Agents, 10%), WI140 (Broker Fees, 10%)
- Admin-configurable ATC table

Step 4 — Tax Year Initialization
- Confirm active taxable year
- Initialize return slots: 8 returns if COR includes 2551Q; 4 returns (1701Q x3 + 1701A) if COR does not
- Election flag defaulted to "Not Yet Elected"
- Income type flag stored (`PURE_SELF_EMPLOYMENT` or `MIXED_INCOME`) — used in all downstream computations

---

### 4. `/income`
**BIR Form 2307 Manager**

List view:
- All 2307 certificates for the active taxable year
- Grouped by quarter, then by payor (each payor gets a sub-header with name, TIN, and certificate count; rows show ATC, Gross, CWT, Status, Actions)
- Add New Certificate button
- Running totals at top: YTD Gross, YTD CWT, VAT Threshold %

Add/Edit Certificate modal:
- Period covered (quarter selector)
- Payor TIN and Name
- ATC Code (dropdown from lookup table)
- Monthly amounts: Month 1, Month 2, Month 3 (auto-sums to quarterly total)
- CWT Withheld (auto-validated against ATC rate × gross, ±₱1.00 tolerance)
- Warning shown if CWT mismatch detected
- Save triggers recascade of all affected return computations

Consolidated Income Summary:
- Table of all certificates: Quarter | Payor | ATC | Gross | CWT
- "Export PDF" button downloads a printable, BIR-style summary attachable to 1701A (uses the active-year selector)

---

### 5. `/election`
**Tax Rate Election**

Only accessible if Q1 2551Q has not yet been filed.

- **Three valid election methods — system supports all three:**
  1. **Item 13 on Q1 Form 2551Q** — standard path for taxpayers whose COR includes 2551Q
  2. **Item 16 on Q1 Form 1701Q** — valid alternative; applicable to taxpayers whose COR does NOT include 2551Q. For these users, the Q1 1701Q is the first (and only quarterly income tax) return, and Item 16 is where the election is declared. Legal basis: RR No. 8-2018 Sec. 3; RMC No. 32-2018; RMO No. 23-2018 Sec. 7.
  3. **BIR Form 1905 (COR update)** — election via RDO; when recorded the system resolves the actual BIR line item (Item 13 or Item 16) from the COR-2551Q flag and stores it in `electionPath`. `electionMethod` is set to `FORM_1905` so the RDO-driven origin is preserved for audit.
- System detects the default path based on the COR 2551Q flag set during onboarding
- `electionPath` always stores the actual BIR line item (`ITEM_13_2551Q_Q1` or `ITEM_16_1701Q_Q1`)
- `electionMethod` stores how the election was recorded (`ITEM_13_2551Q_Q1`, `ITEM_16_1701Q_Q1`, or `FORM_1905`)
- Displays two rate options:
  - (A) Graduated Income Tax Rate on Net Taxable Income
  - (B) 8% Income Tax Rate on Gross Sales/Receipts/Others
- Selecting (B) triggers mandatory confirmation dialog with four disclosures:
  1. Election is irrevocable for the entire taxable year
  2. Percentage tax is eliminated (if 2551Q applies, tax due = ₱0.00 on all quarters)
  3. BIR Form 1701A is the required annual return (or 1701 for mixed-income earners)
  4. Financial Statements are NOT required
- User must check all four disclosures before confirming
- Confirmation timestamped and logged to audit trail, including both `electionPath` and `electionMethod`
- Once confirmed, election flag locked and cascaded to all return computations
- If new taxable year begins, election resets to default (Graduated) and user is prompted to re-elect

## Stellar Integration

### Anchoring Flow

When a return is marked as filed (`POST /api/returns/[id]/file`):

1. System generates the return PDF and stores it in Railway Volume
2. SHA-256 hash of the PDF bytes is computed
3. Two Stellar `manageData` operations are submitted in a single transaction:
   - Key: `kuwenta:ph:${returnId}` (truncated to 64 chars)
     - Value: the 64-character SHA-256 hex hash
   - Key: `kuwenta:ts:${returnId}` (truncated to 64 chars)
     - Value: `filedDate.toISOString()`
   
   The hash and timestamp are split because a single 64-byte manageData value
   cannot hold a 64-character hex hash plus an ISO timestamp.
4. Transaction is signed using the system's Stellar keypair (env: `STELLAR_SECRET_KEY`)
5. TX ID, hash, and timestamp stored in `StellarReceipt` table
6. Explorer URL: `https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/{txId}`

### Verification Flow

Anyone with a TX ID can:
1. Look up the TX on Stellar explorer or via Horizon
2. Read both `manageData` operations (hash under `kuwenta:ph:*`, timestamp under `kuwenta:ts:*`)
3. Compare hash against the original PDF (if available)

### Environment Variables

## Critical Business Rules (Enforced at API Layer)

| Rule | Enforcement Point |
|------|-----------------|
| BR-01: Q1 2551Q must be first | `GET /api/returns/sequence` dependency check; `POST /api/returns/[id]/generate` blocks if prerequisite unmet |
| BR-02: Item 13 on Q1 only | Return generator logic — Item 13 flag injected only for Q1 2551Q |
| BR-03: 8% election irrevocable | `POST /api/election` locks `electionLockedAt`; no update endpoint exists for election |
| BR-04: 2551Q tax due = ₱0 under 8% | Computation engine: if `electedRate === RATE_8PCT`, percentage tax forced to 0 |
| BR-05: 1701Q is cumulative | Computation engine: Q2 pulls Q1+Q2 gross; Q3 pulls Q1+Q2+Q3 gross |
| BR-06: ₱250k exemption applied correctly | Applied in both quarterly 1701Q and annual 1701A formulas |
| BR-07: No FS under 8% | SAWT attachments endpoint suppresses FS line item when `electedRate === RATE_8PCT` |
| BR-08: 1701A not 1701 | Return generator never produces Form 1701 when 8% is elected |
| BR-09: Prior year credit = Carry Over only | `POST /api/prior-year-credit` rejects if `priorDisposition !== 'CARRY_OVER'` |
| BR-10: No cross-tax CWT offset | Computation engine maintains separate credit pools for income tax and percentage tax |
| BR-11: Election resets each year | `TaxYear` record initializes `electionStatus = NOT_ELECTED` on each new year |
| BR-12: VAT threshold revocation | Income ingestion checks running total after every `POST /api/income`; triggers revocation at ₱3,000,000 |
| BR-13: Mixed-income earners — no ₱250k exemption | If `incomeType === MIXED_INCOME`, exemption is set to ₱0 in all 1701Q and 1701A computations. Legal basis: RR No. 8-2018 Sec. 3(D) |
| BR-14: No 2551Q if not in COR | If `corIncludes2551Q === false`, filing sequence skips all 2551Q returns. Election is made via Item 16 on Q1 1701Q instead. Total returns = 4. Legal basis: RMO No. 23-2018 Sec. C.2.1 |
| BR-15: Penalty rates per Ease of Paying Taxes Act | Surcharge = 10% (not 25%); Interest = 6% p.a. (not 12%) for taxpayers with gross receipts < ₱3,000,000. All Kuwenta users qualify. Legal basis: RA No. 11976; RR No. 6-2024; RR No. 8-2024 |
| BR-16: Annual registration fee is ₱30 DST only | The ₱500 annual BIR registration fee was abolished under RA 11976 effective January 22, 2024. Never display or reference ₱500. Only ₱30 Documentary Stamp Tax applies. Legal basis: RA No. 11976 Sec. 18; RR No. 6-2024 |
| BR-17: 1701A is scoped to 8% electees only in Kuwenta | OSD taxpayers on graduated rates also use 1701A in real life, but Kuwenta does not serve them. Hard-block 1701A generation for any user not on active 8% election. Display out-of-scope message for OSD/graduated rate users. |
| BR-18: New registrants who elected 8% on Form 1901 are pre-elected | No Item 13 or Item 16 election required in-app. Mark election as confirmed at onboarding if `isNewRegistrant = true`. Legal basis: RR No. 8-2018 Sec. 3; BIR Form 1901 |

---

## Penalty Computation Logic

```
// Ease of Paying Taxes Act (RA 11976, effective Jan 22, 2024) lowered rates
// for small taxpayers (gross receipts < ₱3,000,000). All Kuwenta users qualify.
// RR No. 6-2024 (effective Apr 27, 2024); RR No. 8-2024

surcharge = (taxDue > 0 && daysLate > 0) ? taxDue * 0.10 : 0   // was 25% under old law
interest  = (taxDue > 0 && daysLate > 0) ? taxDue * 0.06 * (daysLate / 365) : 0  // was 12%
compromise = (daysLate > 0) ? rdoPenaltySchedule[rdoCode].compromiseFee : 0
total = surcharge + interest + compromise
```

Key rule: surcharge and interest are ₱0 when `taxDue = 0`, but compromise penalty still applies.

---

## Filing Due Date Engine

```typescript
const DUE_DATES: Record<string, (year: number) => Date> = {
  '2551Q-Q1': (y) => new Date(y, 3, 25),       // April 25
  '2551Q-Q2': (y) => new Date(y, 6, 25),       // July 25
  '2551Q-Q3': (y) => new Date(y, 9, 25),       // October 25
  '2551Q-Q4': (y) => new Date(y + 1, 0, 25),  // January 25 next year
  '1701Q-Q1': (y) => new Date(y, 4, 15),       // May 15
  '1701Q-Q2': (y) => new Date(y, 7, 15),       // August 15
  '1701Q-Q3': (y) => new Date(y, 10, 15),      // November 15
  '1701A':    (y) => new Date(y + 1, 3, 15),  // April 15 next year
}

// Roll forward if due date falls on weekend or public holiday
function adjustForHoliday(date: Date, holidays: Date[]): Date { ... }

## The Demo Moment

Maria opens the app. She completes onboarding in 3 minutes — TIN, RDO code, ATC codes. She uploads 8 Form 2307 certificates from her two payors. The system validates each one, computes her full-year position: ₱187,009.33 gross, ₱18,700.92 CWT withheld, ₱54,270 carry-over credit, resulting in a ₱72,970.92 overpayment. She elects Carry Over. All 8 returns generate in sequence. SAWT is ready for eSubmission. Her dashboard is fully green.

Each filed return shows a Stellar transaction ID. She taps one — a QR code appears. She hands her phone to a loan officer. The officer scans it, opens the Stellar explorer, sees the hash and timestamp. Compliance confirmed in 30 seconds. No BIR queue. No PDF hunting.
